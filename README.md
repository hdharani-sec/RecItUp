# RecItUp
Streamlined workflow of the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test. This is a continuous development project where new features and services will be added. The goal of this project is to automate the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test to make it as comprehensive and quick as possible. The idea is not to replace reconnaissance completely, but to leverage this project to perform deeper reconnaissance.
